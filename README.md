Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It emphasizes structured processes, collaboration, and best practices to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions. 
Importance in the Technology Industry:  

Scalability: Enables building systems that grow with user demands (e.g., cloud platforms).  
Reliability: Ensures software functions correctly under varying conditions.  
Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork through standardized methodologies.  
Maintenance: Simplifies updates and bug fixes over a product’s lifecycle.  
Innovation: Drives advancements in AI, IoT, and other cutting-edge fields.  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1968 NATO Conference: Coined the term "software engineering" to address the "software crisis" of unreliable, over-budget projects.  
2. 1970s SDLC Formalization: Structured methodologies like the Waterfall model emerged.  
3. 2001 Agile Manifesto: Prioritized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Gathering: Define user needs and system specs.  
2. Design: Create architecture (e.g., UML diagrams).  
3. Implementation: Write code following design specs.  
4. Testing: Validate functionality (unit, integration, etc.).  
5. Deployment: Release to users.  
6. Maintenance: Fix bugs and update features


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall 
Linear, sequential phases
Rigid requirements
Best for: Stable requirements (e.g., banking systems).
Agile
Iterative, incremental cycles (sprints)
Flexible, adaptable to changes
Best for: Dynamic projects (e.g., mobile apps).


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Writes code, debugs, and implements features.  
- QA Engineer: Designs test cases, identifies bugs, and ensures quality.  
- Project Manager: Oversees timelines, budgets, and team coordination.  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one interface.  
- VCS (e.g., Git, SVN): Track changes, enable collaboration, and manage code history.  
Importance: Accelerate development, reduce errors, and streamline teamwork.  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Use Agile to adapt incrementally.  
- Technical Debt: Regular refactoring and code reviews.  
- Communication Gaps: use tools like Slack/Jira and daily standups.  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing: Validates individual components (e.g., a function).  
2. Integration Testing: Checks interactions between modules.  
3. System Testing: Tests the entire system end-to-end.  
4. Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user requirements.  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Crafting precise inputs to guide AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) to produce desired outputs.  
Importance: Reduces ambiguity, improves accuracy, and saves time.  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Write about climate change.
- Improved Prompt: Explain the impact of carbon emissions on global warming between 2000–2020 in 3 bullet points.
